## 📂 Project background & timeline

This project was done over the course of 3 days in February 2024.
It is my personal version of a team project I was involved in during the AI Bootcamp in Ghent, Belgium, 2024.

Its main goals were to practice:

- building a data set from scratch
- scraping data from the web at scale
- practicing threading, multiprocessing
- practicing exception handling, error handling

## ⚠️ Warning

All my code is currently heavily:

- docstringed
- commented

.. and sometimes typed.

This is to help me learn and to make my sessions with our training coach more efficient.
