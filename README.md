## 📖 Description

This Data Collector is designed to collect data on real estate properties for sale across Belgium.
It is phase 1 of a total of 4 phases of a larger project to develop a machine learning model for price prediction. See phase 2 (data analysis) [here](https://github.com/emsuru/charlie-02-data-analysis) and phase 3 (ML model development) [here]((https://github.com/emsuru/charlie-03-ML-model-development)).

## 🛠️ Features

- Scrapes real estate listings from the largest Belgian real estate website
- Builds a dataset with detailed property information
- Saves data in both JSON and CSV formats for further analysis


## 👩‍💻 Usage

## 📂 Project background & timeline

This project was done over the course of 3 days in February 2024.
It is my personal version of a team project I was involved in during the AI Bootcamp in Ghent, Belgium, 2024. 

Its main goals were to practice:

- building a data set completely from scratch
- scraping data from the web at scale
- practicing threading, multiprocessing
- practicing exception handling, error handling

## ⚠️ Warning

All my code is currently heavily:

- docstringed
- commented

.. and sometimes typed.

This is to help me learn and to make my sessions with our training coach more efficient.
